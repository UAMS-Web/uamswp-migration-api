## Branches and environments

Every change starts as an issue, is built on a branch linked to that issue, and reaches production through a pull request to `main`. This section covers that path and what each pull request's test plan has to cover.

| Branch | Role | Where its test plan runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | Default branch, production | The local environment, before the pull request merges |

## From issue to merge

1. **File or pick up an issue.** The work is described there, with acceptance criteria.
2. **Create a branch from `main`, linked to the issue.** Use the issue's **Create a branch** link, or:

   ```sh
   gh issue develop <number> --base main --name <number>-<short-slug> --checkout
   ```

   The link shows the branch, and later its pull requests, on the issue.
3. **Open a pull request from the branch to `main`.** It carries the full description: what changed, why, and how it was verified. Its test plan is run on the local environment, and its boxes are checked before review.

## Test plans

Every pull request ends with a `## Test plan` checklist. Its first line names the environment it was run on, and every item is something a reviewer can check there:

- **Pull request to `main`:** "Run on the local environment." Items are things you checked yourself there: a page, a role, a save, a command. Check a box only for a check you actually ran.

The [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md) fills in the skeleton when a pull request is opened on GitHub.

## Agents

Coding agents follow the same path. Their instructions are in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the shared skills and rules under `.claude/`, which are synced from `UAMS-Web/uams-claude-skills`.

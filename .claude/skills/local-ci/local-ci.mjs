// local-ci.mjs: the shared local CI runner (UAMS-Web/uams-claude-skills#11).
//
// Runs a repository's checks on the developer's machine, with no Docker, no
// act, and no GitHub Actions minutes, and prints a verdict a reviewer can read.
// One file, no dependencies, Node 20 or newer, macOS, Linux and Windows.
//
// This file is delivered unchanged to every repository that carries the
// `local-ci` profile. NOTHING repository-specific lives in it: every job, path
// and version comes from `local-ci.json` at the repository root, which the
// repository owns and the sync never touches.
//
// WHAT A RUN DOES
//     1. Finds the repository root from this file's own location, so a copy in
//        a worktree validates that worktree's tree and nothing else.
//     2. Reads `local-ci.json`. In a runner-owned slot, runs the `prepare`
//        steps it names (see PREPARE) before anything else is read.
//     3. Lists the files changed on the branch: the diff of HEAD against its
//        merge base with `origin/<base>`, plus every uncommitted change.
//        Deleted files count as changed. With no merge base (a shallow clone)
//        the diff cannot be listed, and the run refuses unless --all or
//        --jobs makes the selection independent of it.
//     4. Selects jobs: the `guard` job (when `guard.deny` is set) always runs
//        first; a configured job runs when one of its `paths` globs matches a
//        changed file, when it has `always: true`, or when `--all` or `--jobs`
//        names it. Everything else is reported SKIPPED (not selected).
//     5. Runs the selected jobs through the shell, from the repository root.
//        `chain: true` stops at the first failure; the default runs every
//        selected job and reports all of them.
//     6. Prints the summary: the commit, each job with PASS / FAIL / SKIPPED
//        and its duration, and the verdict. Exits 1 when any job that ran
//        failed, 0 otherwise, 4 when another run holds the worktree (see ONE RUN AT A TIME), and 128 plus the signal number when a job is killed by SIGINT, SIGTERM or SIGHUP (POSIX only). The summary and the exit status are derived from
//        the same results, so they cannot disagree. A run in which no job ran
//        exits 0 with the verdict NOTHING RAN, never PASS.
//
// ONE RUN AT A TIME
//     Before step 2 (before the slot is prepared under --branch), the run takes
//     a lock on the worktree it executes in: a sibling directory
//     `<worktree>.lock` holding `holder.json` (pid, branch, worktree,
//     startedAt). A second run against a worktree a live run holds exits 4
//     before any job, naming the holder. A lock whose pid is gone is reclaimed
//     with a warning; a record that cannot be read is never reclaimed. The lock
//     is released on success, on failure, on an error, and when a job is
//     interrupted. --dry-run without --branch changes nothing and takes none.
//
// USAGE
//     node .claude/skills/local-ci/local-ci.mjs [options]
//
// OPTIONS
//     --all              Run every configured job, whatever the diff says.
//     --jobs <a,b>       Run only the named jobs (the guard still runs first).
//     --base <ref>       Diff against the merge base with origin/<ref> instead
//                        of the config's `base`.
//     --dry-run          Print the plan (which jobs would run and why) and exit.
//     --comment          After the run, post the summary as a comment on the
//                        open pull request for the current branch (through
//                        `gh`), naming the validated commit. Refused when the
//                        tree is dirty: the verdict would describe no commit.
//     --branch <name>    Validate origin/<name> in a runner-owned worktree slot
//                        instead of in place. The name must exist on origin
//                        (refused before anything is checked out); the slot is
//                        a sibling of the primary checkout named `<primary>-ci`,
//                        detached at the fetched remote head (a worktree there
//                        that the runner did not create is refused, never moved:
//                        pass --worktree-path), so the invoking
//                        checkout's HEAD, index and files never move. When the
//                        branch's copy of this runner differs from the executing
//                        one, that copy runs the whole chain in the slot (once:
//                        the child carries LOCAL_CI_HANDOFF, set to the parent's
//                        pid, and never hands off).
//                        --dry-run still prepares the slot, because the plan
//                        depends on the branch's config and diff.
//     --worktree-path <dir>  Place the slot elsewhere. Needs --branch.
//     --commit-status    Post the verdict as a commit status on the validated
//                        commit (POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/statuses/<sha> through
//                        gh): state `success` when the run exits 0 and `failure`
//                        when it exits 1, under the config's "statusContext"
//                        (default "local-ci"). It is opt-in, because a developer
//                        running the checks on their own branch should not write
//                        to GitHub. It is posted once, when the run is over: never
//                        `pending`, so a run that dies leaves no status behind
//                        (a required status then waits for one). A run in which
//                        nothing ran posts nothing. A status that cannot be posted
//                        warns and never changes the exit status. Refused on a
//                        dirty tree.

//     run      a shell command, run from the repository root. When its first
//              word is `php` or starts with `vendor/bin/`, it runs under the
//              resolved PHP (see TOOLCHAIN) so the version the config names is
//              the version that runs, and so Windows' `.bat` shims in
//              vendor/bin are never spawned directly.
//     paths    globs over repository-relative paths. `*` and `?` stay inside
//              one path segment; `**` crosses segments; `{a,b}` is a choice of
//              literals; a leading `!` excludes. `*.php` matches only at the
//              root; `**/*.php` matches everywhere; `!vendor/**` keeps a
//              committed vendor/ out.
//     each     globs; the command runs once per tracked file that matches,
//              with the file appended (for `php -l`). When `paths` is absent
//              the `each` globs select the job too.
//     always   true: selected on every run.
//     requires the tooling the job needs, so a repository without it stays
//              green. Each entry is a repository-relative path that must exist
//              (`cspell.json`, `node_modules/.bin/cspell`) or `bin:<name>`, a
//              command that must be on PATH (`bin:python`). When any entry is
//              absent the job is SKIPPED, with the entry named, rather than
//              run and failed. A skip is never a pass: the summary says
//              `tooling absent`; a run whose selected jobs were all skipped this way
//              is NOTHING RAN, and a run where some passed and some were skipped
//              this way is `PASS (incomplete)`, never a bare PASS.
//     mutation `{"minScore": 100}`: the job's output is part of its verdict. The
//              command's output is read for Pest's `N Mutations for M Files
//              created` line and its `Score: N%` line, and the job fails when
//              the first line is absent, when either count is 0 (Pest exits 0
//              on `0 Mutations for 0 Files created`), when the score line is
//              absent, or when the score is below `minScore` (default 100).
//              Not combinable with `each`.
//     parallel `{"serialGroup": "serial", "memoryLimit": "4G"}`: runs the job as
//              two parts, for a Pest suite with tests that cannot run in
//              parallel. `run` must start with `vendor/bin/pest`. Part one is
//              `run --parallel --exclude-group=<serialGroup>`; part two, the
//              serial tail, is `run --group=<serialGroup>`. Both always run,
//              and the job fails when either fails, with the summary naming
//              which. `serialGroup` defaults to `serial`. `memoryLimit` (a
//              PHP size such as `4G`, or `-1`) is set as `-d memory_limit` on
//              both parts and forwarded to the parallel workers with
//              `--passthru-php`, because workers are their own PHP processes
//              and otherwise run at the system CLI limit. Not combinable with
//              `each` or `mutation`.
//     php      "8.2": this job runs on that PHP instead of the run's, for a
//              `php -l` over the shipped files under the supported floor while
//              the rest of the run uses the development PHP. `run` must start
//              with `php` or `vendor/bin/`. It resolves from
//              LOCAL_CI_PHP_<major><minor> (LOCAL_CI_PHP_82), Herd's pinned
//              binary, or php8.2 / php82 on PATH, never from plain `php`, and
//              the run fails before any job when that PHP is missing or reports
//              another version: a newer parser accepts what the floor rejects.
//
// PREPARE: bringing a reused slot in line with the commit (opt-in)
//     "prepare": {
//       "residue":    ["tests", "includes"],   refuse untracked files here
//       "submodules": ["content", "users"],    check these out at their gitlinks
//       "patches":    true                     re-sync vendor/ to patches.lock.json
//     }
//
//     Runs only in a slot the runner created (--branch, or a run started inside
//     that slot), before the tree is described and before any job. In any other
//     checkout the run says it did not prepare and carries on. --dry-run names
//     the steps without running them. In order:
//     residue     fails, naming each path, when a listed path holds a file that
//                 is neither tracked nor ignored. Nothing is deleted.
//     submodules  `git submodule update --init` for the listed paths only, then
//                 checks each is at the gitlink the commit records. A listed path
//                 that is not a submodule, or an uninitialized one that holds
//                 files, fails. Other submodules are left alone.
//     patches     when patches.lock.json differs from the copy recorded at
//                 vendor/.local-ci-patches.lock.json (or none is recorded),
//                 `composer reinstall` the installed packages either lock
//                 patches, then records the new lock, only after that succeeds.
//                 Nothing happens when vendor/ is not installed.
//
// DATABASE: a job's own test database (opt-in, per job)
//     "database": {
//       "name": "app_ci",                       the runner's own database
//       "env":  "WP_TESTS_DB_NAME",             the variable that carries it
//       "lock": { "prefix": "app-ci",           the suite's lock file prefix
//                 "heldEnv": "LOCAL_CI_SUITE_LOCK_HELD" }
//     }
//
//     The job runs with `name` in `env`, and with every other variable any
//     job's `database` names removed from its environment. A job without
//     `database` gets the runner's environment unchanged. With `lock`, the run
//     takes <tmpdir>/<prefix>.database.<16 hex of sha256(name)>.lock (JSON with
//     an integer `pid`, created exclusively) before any job runs, the file a
//     suite started by hand takes too, and exits 4 when a live process holds it
//     (naming the holder) or its record cannot be read (naming the file). The
//     record is linked into place whole, so the file is never seen empty.
//     `heldEnv` (optional) is set to "1" for the job, telling the suite its
//     parent holds the lock. The runner does not create the database.
//
// TOOLCHAIN
//     PHP resolves to, in order: `LOCAL_CI_PHP` (an absolute path); on macOS,
//     Herd's version-pinned binary for the config's `php` (`php82` for "8.2",
//     under ~/Library/Application Support/Herd/bin); then `php` on PATH. A
//     missing Herd pin falls through to PATH (with a version warning when it
//     differs from the config). It is resolved only when a selected job needs
//     it, so a repository with no PHP job runs on a machine with no PHP. A
//     version other than the config's warns; a missing PHP fails before any
//     job runs. --dry-run lists the search order and notes when a Herd pin is
//     absent so the plan is not read as a guarantee that pin will run. A job
//     that names its own `php` resolves it separately (see `php` above).
//
// EXPORTS

Usage:
  node .claude/skills/local-ci/local-ci.mjs [--all | --jobs <a,b>] [--base <ref>] [--dry-run] [--comment]
                                            [--commit-status] [--branch <name> [--worktree-path <dir>]]
  node .claude/skills/local-ci/local-ci.mjs --drop-patch-record

Options:
  --all           Run every job in local-ci.json, whatever the diff says.
  --jobs <a,b>    Run only the named jobs. The guard job still runs first.
  --base <ref>    Diff against the merge base with origin/<ref> (default: the
                  config's "base", then "main").
  --dry-run       Print which jobs would run, and why, without running them.
  --comment       Post the summary as a pull request comment through gh, naming
                  the validated commit. Refused when the tree is dirty.
  --commit-status Post the verdict as a commit status on the validated commit
                  through the REST API, under the config's "statusContext"
                  (default "local-ci"). Off unless given. Refused when the tree
                  is dirty.
  --branch <name> Validate origin/<name> in a runner-owned worktree slot, detached
                  at the remote head, and run the branch's own copy of this
                  runner there. This checkout is never moved. A name that is not
                  on origin is refused before anything is checked out.
  --worktree-path <dir>
                  Where the slot lives (default: a sibling of the primary
                  checkout, named <primary>-ci). Needs --branch.
  --drop-patch-record
                  Delete the patch record (vendor/.local-ci-patches.lock.json) in
                  the tree this runner lives in, then exit. A repository's install
                  script runs it before composer install, so an install that
                  dies after re-extracting a patched package cannot leave a record
                  that vouches for an unpatched vendor/. Takes no other option.

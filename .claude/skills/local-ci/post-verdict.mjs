/**
 * Post the gate's verdict comment on a pull request and, on a hand-back, apply the
 * `handed-back` label in the same run (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic#2845,
 * UAMS-Web/uams-claude-skills#120).
 *
 * The verdict comment and the label used to be two separate `gh api` calls, and the
 * second was the one that got missed: six of eight hand-backs read from their label
 * events carried no `handed-back` at all, which leaves queue depth counting work that
 * is waiting on its author. Folding the label into the command that posts the comment
 * removes the call that could be skipped, rather than asking for it to be remembered.
 *
 * WHAT A HAND-BACK IS. A red chain, or a finding a review caught on a green one. Both
 * pass `--hand-back`. A green verdict with no finding passes nothing and never touches
 * the labels.
 *
 * REMOVAL IS NOT HERE. The `handed-back-label` skill's workflow removes the label when
 * the pull request is pushed to. This script only ever adds it.
 *
 * READ BACK, NOT TRUSTED. After the writes, the pull request's labels are read again and
 * the run fails unless they agree with what was asked: `handed-back` present after a
 * hand-back. A comment that posted while the label did not is reported as exactly that,
 * so the gate knows the comment is on the record and only the label needs retrying.
 *
 * REST only, so a spent GraphQL quota does not stop a verdict being recorded.
 *
 * REPOSITORY. `--repo <owner/name>` names it; without the flag it is read from the `origin`
 * remote of the current directory, and the run fails naming `--repo` when that is not a
 * GitHub remote.
 *
 * Usage:  node .claude/skills/local-ci/post-verdict.mjs <pr-number> <body-file> [--hand-back] [--repo <owner/name>]
 * Output: one JSON object: `{"comment", "handedBack", "labels", "warning"}`. `warning` is null
 *         unless a green verdict found `handed-back` still on the pull request, which it
 *         also prints to stderr.
 * Exit:   0 = everything asked for is on the pull request, read back.
 *         1 = the arguments are wrong, a call failed, or the read-back disagrees.
